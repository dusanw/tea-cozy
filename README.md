This is a complete page as it should look like by the design spec from codeacademy. It works fine in full view, but when go tablet or mobile view, the location section does not display properly. It scrolls through the fixed nav position, it's not responsive correctly at the bottom only. If you could help me out and tell me whats wrong, i'd be very gratefull.
